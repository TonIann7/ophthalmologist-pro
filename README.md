Tecnologie web project

## Project description

This project aims to create a progressive web app that can assist the ophthalmologist during the specialist examination by keeping track of the measurements taken. At the end of the eye examination, pwa generates the eye prescription automatically according to the data entered by the doctor. Once the prescription has been generated, it is always accessible through the portal by both the doctor and the customer .

We recommend viewing the video presentation to better understand the initial idea .
